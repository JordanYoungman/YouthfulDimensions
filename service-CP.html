        <h3> The Purpose of a Chemical Peel </h3>
  		  <p>
          To improve the appearance of the skin, correct the appearance of facial blemishes, and to reduce the effects of smoking and sun exposure.
          Peels can also be used for reducing uneven pigmentation, acne and acne scarring and other skin conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          A chemical peel is designed to accelerate the removal of old, dead skin cells at the surface of the skin to promote new cell growth and can be used to
          treat a particular area (such as lines around the eyes or mouth), or all over the face, arms, hands and neck.
        </p>
        <h3> Types of CP On Offer </h3>

        <h3> Preparation for the Treatment </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The client needs to know what to expect from a chemical peel. Chemical peels cannot change pore size, tighten loose skin or re-move deep scars.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some doctors prescribe a pre-treatment skin regime (for four to eight weeks), to prepare a patient's skin and speed the healing process. You should avoid electrolysis and sunbeds for a couple of weeks before treatment and wear a sunblock after treatment.

          <p>Information before having a chemical peel. </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Refrain from any other chemical peels. In the two weeks leading up to a chemical peel, it is imperative that you refrain from having any other chemical peel treatments. If it has been less than two weeks since your last chemical peel, you should wait until at least 14 days have passed. </li>
            <li> Avoid microdermabrasion treatments. Microdermabrasion treatments work similar to chemical peels, except this treatment uses a gentle abrasive tool to peel off the outer layer of skin.  If you are planning on having a chemical peel performed, you should avoid having a microdermabrasion treatment for at least 14 days before the procedure.</li>
            <li> Avoid tanning booths. Tanning, including the use of artificial UV radiation in tanning booths, can cause significant damage to the skin. For this reason, it is imperative that anyone planning on having a chemical peel avoid tanning for at least two to three weeks before the treatment. </li>
            <li> Limit sun exposure. While you should not engage in tanning for two to three weeks before a chemical peel, you should also limit all sun exposure for at least ten days before the treatment. If you must be in the sun for any duration of time in the two to three weeks before a treatment, you should wear sunscreen and try to limit your time outdoors as much as possible. </li>
            <li> Be gentle on your skin. As you prepare for a chemical peel, you will need to refrain from waxing your skin or using chemical depilatory (hair removal) treatments for at least five to seven days before treatment. You should also avoid all chemical injection treatments, including Botox and collagen injections, for at least one week before the treatment. </li>
            <li> Take antiviral medication as needed. Some people preparing for a chemical peel will not need to take antiviral medication. However, if you have a history of herpes infections on or around your mouth, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication for you to take before and after the treatment. </li>
            <li> Apply prescribed lotions. Depending on the depth of chemical peel you will be undergoing, your doctor may recommend that you use a moisturizing and healing lotion on your skin before the treatment.  </li>
            <li> Glycolic acid lotion is typically recommended for light chemical peels. This lotion is used for two weeks before the treatment to help ensure that your skin peels uniformly and heals more easily. </li>
            <li> A retinoid cream like tretinoin or Retin-A is used for light or medium chemical peels to help shorten the duration of your treatment and speed up the healing process. Retinoid use is typically discontinued three days before the treatment. </li>
          </ul>

          <h3> Post-Peel Do’s: </h3>
          <ul>
            <li> Do treat your skin gently. Be sure to use a very, very light touch when massaging any type of product onto your skin. No aggressive rubbing at all. Some of the flaking cells are still attached to live cells, and you don’t want to risk pulling anything off that isn’t ready.</li>
            <li> Do be extra careful when the skin is wet. Water melts and softens dead skin, so it’s very easy to rub off both dead and live cells when the skin is moist. This means avoid using washcloths or sonic cleansing brushes. </li>
            <li> Do wear sunscreen. Stating the obvious, but the skin is very vulnerable post-peel. UV light (even daylight on a cloudy day) is damaging your skin. If the skin is overly flaky and you’re being mindful of not touching it too often, consider trying an SPF-infused powder. You can dust it on for a quick and easy, rub-free reapplication.</li>
            <li> Do limit your time outdoors. You want to hibernate as much as possible to keep your skin protected. The last things you want to expose your skin to are heat and UV light. It’s already in such an inflamed state, you don’t want to make it worse.</li>
            <li> Do use products with soothing ingredients. You want to provide as much comfort to the skin as possible to ease redness and irritation. I have every one of my clients use a water-based gel mask (no more than once a day) if they feel like their skin is too uncomfortable. I suggest keeping it in the refrigerator to provide an extra cooling experience.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3> Post-Peel Don’ts: </h3>
          <ul>
            <li> Don’t pick or pull at the flaky skin! The whole purpose of a chemical peel is to lift away surface dry, damaged cell layers and reveal younger-looking, healthy new cells. But to do this, the skin has to shed. That’s the part that people dislike the most. Picking off dry, flaky skin when it may not be ready to come off can result in scarring and unnecessary redness. You really have to leave it alone. Again, let Mother Nature her do her job.</li>
            <li> Don’t use a washcloth, facial scrub or sonic cleansing brush. As mentioned above, dead, flaky skin softens up when exposed to water. It can be very tempting to want to rub away that dryness with a washcloth, or facial scrub. Please don’t use any of these. Should any new cells come along with it (which they will!), you’ll wind up with scabs all over your face. This certainly defeats any benefits from getting the peel in the first place.</li>
            <li> Don’t over-moisturise to compensate for post-peeling dryness. When the skin is peeling and flaky, it’s normal to want to continually apply a skin oil or heavy moisturizer to comfort and alleviate dryness. While you want to keep the skin moist because moisturisers can aid healing and you certainly don’t want the skin to crack, it’s important to know that the whole purpose of a chemical peel is to peel. The less rubbing, massaging and tugging on the skin you do, the better. Just use a comforting moisturiser and let the skin do what it wants to do—shed. </li>
            <li> Don’t exfoliate with acids or enzymes.  It is so important to not remove the peeling skin before its time. You must let the skin shed naturally on its schedule, not on yours. Acids and enzymes, whether in a cleanser, toner, serum, mask or moisturiser, will only irritate the skin further and possibly burn and temporarily scar the skin. Wait at two weeks before exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Don’t eat highly acidic foods. Just as you don’t want to apply topical acids to the skin, you also don’t want acidic foods getting on the skin. When things like tomato sauce, oranges and salsa touch the face, they can lower the pH of the skin to the point of causing serious irritation. When you have a peel, your moisture barrier is in a very damaged state and acts extremely sensitive and particularly. Since the mouth area is the place where you’ll see most amount of peeling due to facial movements from talking and yawning, this area can be very reactive.</li>
            <li> Don’t sweat too much. Especially at the height of the peeling, your protective barrier is very damaged. When you sweat while working out, the salt can cause a stinging sensation which may further the irritation.</li>
            <li> Don’t use any type of retinol or prescription retinoids. These types of products work to stimulate cell turnover from deep. This is definitely great for the skin, but it’s what’s already occurring because of the peel. Like acids, you’ll want to use these once your skin heals.</li>
