		  <p>How does microdermabrasion work?</p>

<p>Over the course of your facial treatments a wand delivering a fine jet of abrasive crystals will be passed over the skin. Dead skin particles will be abraded away, and a vacuum action will remove the debris.

This dual action will both resurface the skin and stimulate the blood flow, encouraging the skin to rejuvenate itself and produce collagen and elastin.
With each of your subsequent treatments, the intensity of the facial microdermabrasion can be increased – reaching to deeper layers and successfully removing acne scarring, lifting pigmentation and smoothing fine lines and wrinkles.</p>

			<button class="collapsible">Day of Treatment:</button>
			<div class="content">
			<p>Youthful Dimensions will determine your individual needs and devise a treatment plan to achieve the results that you require. Treatments plans can vary from single ‘beauty boost’ treatments to courses of 6 to 20 treatments every 7 to 10 days.

A cleanser will be used to ensure that your skin is clean and dry before the treatment commences. For male clients, ideally your face should be clean shaved the night before a treatment (this is not essential). Dry, shaven and clean skin means that the abrasive compound can penetrate the skin unobstructed.</p>

		<p> After the treatment?</p>
		<p> a simple moisturiser with a neutral pH (pH 4.5 – pH 7) and without any essential oils, AHA’s, glycolics or retinol should be applied to replenish lost moisture and to prevent the skin becoming dry and peeling.
Sun damage can cause pigmentation and premature ageing of the skin. After a SkinBase™ Facial it is essential to protect the skin from excessive sun exposure by applying a moisturiser with an SPF. This is especially true in the summer months and for clients that are having SkinBase™ Facials to treat pigmentation. Failure to apply regular sun cream could cause the pigmentation to return.</p>

				<p>CONSULTATION</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When having your first Microdermabrasion treatment you will be provided with the full and in-depth consultation to assess your needs and to check for contra-indications. You will be asked to complete a consultation/ record card which will be referred to on future appointments. All information provided remain private and confidential.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>HOME PREPARATION</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Please do not exfoliate your skin for 48 hours prior to your treatment.</li>
				<li>For male clients, ideally your face should be clean shaved the night before a treatment (this is not essential). Dry, shaven and clean skin means that the abrasive compound can penetrate the skin unobstructed.</li>
				<li>Arrive for your treatment fresh and clean.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>THE PROCEDURE</p>
			<ul>
				<li>After your consultation you will be asked to lay accordingly on the couch.</li>
				<li>A cleanser will be applied to the area being treated to ensure that your skin is clean before the treatment commences.</li>
				<li>After drying the skin, the microdermabrasion machine will be started and by gently pressing the wand to your skin, a fine jet of abrasive crystals is passed over the treatment area.</li>
				<li>Dead skin particles will be abraded away, and a vacuum action will remove the debris.  After passing across the skin area once, the therapist will then target problem areas like open pores, pigmentation, fine lines, wrinkles, blemishes and acne scarring.</li>
				<li>After the treatment a toner will be applied followed by a moisturiser which is pH neutral and contains no essential oils, AHA’s, glycolics or retinol will be applied to replenish lost moisture and to prevent the skin becoming dry and peeling.</li>
				<li>Sun damage can cause pigmentation and premature ageing of the skin. After a microdermabrasion treatment it is essential to protect the skin from excessive sun exposure by applying an SPF. This is especially true in the summer months and for clients that are having microdermabrasion to treat pigmentation. Failure to apply regular sun cream could cause the pigmentation to return.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>AFTERCARE ADVICE</p> 
			<ul>
				<li>We recommend that you adhere to the following advice after having microdermabrasion treatment:</li>
				<li>12 Hours: Do not wear heavy make-up (mineral based make-up is better).</li>
				<li>24 Hours: No Swimming, waxing of the area that has been treated or fake tan application.</li>
				<li> 48 Hours: No Sauna, sun beds or sun exposure. No Botox, collagen injections or dermal fillers.</li>
				<li>72 Hours: Do not use any anti-ageing creams, AHA's glycolics, retinol or exfoliation products.</li>
			</ul>

		<button class="collapsible">Microdermabrasion Information:</button>
			<div class="content">
          <p>Microdermabrasion treatment uses a stream of non-allergenic crystals to remove your skin’s outermost layers of dead cells.  A handset will be used to direct the stream of crystal over the treatment area and, where necessary, target specific zones. The handset then uses a mild suction to draw away the crystal and skin debris to reveal your new and improved complexion.</p>
		  <p>Microdermabrasion is chemical free and non-invasive yet achieves amazing results revealing younger, healthier looking skin from the very first treatment. The skin’s appearance is further improved through increased collagen & elastin production as your body produces a new layer of skin.
			Microdermabrasion Facial is a progressive rather than aggressive treatment, during which you’ll feel completely relaxed and pampered with no discomfort from the facial.</p>
