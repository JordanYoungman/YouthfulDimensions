		  <p>The PDO Thread Lift is a treatment which lifts and tightens sagging skin tissue, using threads made of Polydioxanone (PDO). The threads are inserted into the deeper layers of the skin. Once inserted, the threads produce 3 effects in the skin:</p>
		  <ul>
            <li>Instant Skin Lifting through mechanical effects</li>
            <li>Cellular Renewal, through Collagen stimulation, and neovascularisation to improve skin texture, fine lines and elasticity</li>
            <li>Skin Tightening, by contracting fat tissue.</li>
          </ul>
            <p>Within the First Hour of Treatment</p>
		  <ul>	
            <li>Immediately after the treatment, there may be redness, bruising, swelling, tenderness, and/or itching near the injection site. Avoid itching, massaging, or picking around the injection site. This is normal and generally disappears within a few hours to a few days. If these symptoms last more than 3 days, please contact me.</li>
			<li>You will be provided with an ice pack and you can apply arnica cream and take arnica tablets, - all of which can reduce or resolve potential bruising</li>
			<li>Avoid drinking alcohol or partaking in strenuous exercise, as it may result in additional bruising. </li>
			<li>Until the swelling and redness have resolved, avoid intense heat in the treated area(s). This includes sunbathing, sun beds, saunas, hot tubs, or hot wax. Also avoid extreme cold such as skiing or other winter sports. </li>
            <li>Minimise movement of the treated area(s). However, if there is a visible bump, you can massage the area. Depending on the areas treated and the product used, you may feel "firmness". These areas will soften and settle with time (usually 1-2 weeks)</li>
            <li>Sunscreen and makeup can be applied, and the area can be gently washed with a gentle cleanser. </li>
            <li>98% of skin damage (aging, wrinkles, dark spots, and hyper-pigmentation) is caused by sun damage. Wearing sunscreen is critical to maintaining the look and health of your skin. Sunscreen should be re-applied after every 4 hours of sun exposure. It is recommended a sunscreen with an SPF 45 or greater to be used.</li>
          </ul>
		  <h3>Please Contact Youthful Dimensions Immediately if You Experience</h3>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Fever and/or chills</li>
		  <li>If the area appears red, hot to the touch, and "angry" looking. </li>
		  <li>Severe pain or increasing pain </li>
		  <li>Discoloured blotches in areas not injected or blanching of injected areas</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>How Long Will Dermal Fillers Last?
The short answer is, of course, it depends - what areas were treated, and with which specific product. Cosmetic fillers are long lasting, but not permanent.
Shorter term fillers made of hyaluronic acid, like Juvederm and Revolax, will last anywhere from 6-18 months depending on the areas treated and your bodies metabolism.</p>

          <h3 class="my-3">Dermal Filler Information</h3>
          <p>To reduce the amount of bruising and/or swelling from the injection sites, please follow the instructions below. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Avoid blood thinning over-the-counter medications such as Aspirin, Wafarin and Ibuprofen for 1 week prior. Please consult your Doctor if you are taking Aspirin and Warfarin for medical reasons!  If you continue to take these medications the chances of developing an injection-related hematoma (blood clot) which can leave a dark spot if it becomes entrapped in the filler implant is higher. The dark spot may remain until the filler is naturally dissolved.</li>
            <li>Avoid supplements including St. Johns Wort, ginko biloba, primrose oil, garlic, ginseng, and Vitamin E for 1 week</li>
            <li>Avoid topical products such as Retin-A, Retinols, Retinoids, Glycolic Acid, or any "Anti-Aging" products for 3 days prior</li>
            <li>Avoid waxing, bleaching, tweezing, or hair removal cream on the area to be treated for 3 days prior</li>
			<li>Do not drink alcoholic beverages for 24-48 hours prior to treatment as this may also increase the risk of bleeding and/or bruising.</li>
			<li>If you have previously suffered from facial cold sores, there is a risk that the needle punctures could contribute to another eruption of cold sores. Please let Youthful Dimensions know if you are prone to cold sores.</li>
			<li>Do not use dermal fillers if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, are allergic to any ingredients, or suffer from neurological disorders. Please inform us if you have any questions about this prior to your treatment.</li>
			<li>Do not plan any social events for the next 3-7 days as you may have bruising and/or swelling lasting this long or longer. You can cover up bruising with makeup.</li>
